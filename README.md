# De-COW(Vuln_Machine)

Name of vulnerable machine: <b>De_COW</b>.

#### What is De-COW:
This is a vulnerable machine made for a CTF. In this vulnerable machine Dirty COW vulnerability is established. Dirty COW vulnerability is a type of privilege escalation exploit, which essentially means that it can be used to gain root-user access on any Linux-based system.  While security experts claim that such kinds of exploits are not uncommon, its easy-to-exploit nature and the fact that it has been around for more than 11 years is pretty worrisome. Dirty COW gets its name from the <b>copy-on-write (COW)</b> mechanism in the kernel's memory management system. Malicious programs can potentially set up a race condition to turn a read-only mapping of a file into a writable mapping. Thus, an underprivileged user could utilize this flaw to elevate their privileges on the system. By gaining root privileges, malicious programs obtain unrestricted access to the system. From there on, it can modify system files, deploy keyloggers, access personal data stored on your device, etc.
